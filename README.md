# Carbon-Chain
A blockchain-based blue carbon registry system that leverages AI/ML and public environmental datasets to transparently measure, verify, and record carbon credits from coastal ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses. The project promotes climate action, trust in carbon markets, and sustainable community-driven conservation.
